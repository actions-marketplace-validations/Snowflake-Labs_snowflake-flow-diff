This action is brought to you by [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/), don't hesitate to visit our website and reach out to us if you have questions about this action.

## Usage

When using the GitHub Flow Registry Client in NiFi to version control your flows, add the below file `.github/workflows/flowdiff.yml` to the repository into which flow definitions are versioned.

Whenever a pull request is opened, reopened or when a new commit is pushed to an existing pull request, this workflow will be triggered and will compare the modified flow(s) in the pull request and will
automatically comment the pull request with a human readable description of the changes included in the pull request.

```yaml
name: Snowflake Flow Diff on Pull Requests
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]

    steps:

      - name: Checkout PR code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
          fetch-depth: 0
          path: submitted-changes

      # getting the path of the flow definition(s) that changed
      - name: Get changed files
        id: files
        run: |
          cd submitted-changes

          # 1. grab every changed connector JSON
          files=$(git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD origin/${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}) HEAD | grep '\.json$')

          # 2. make it a comma-separated list (no trailing comma)
          bare=$(echo "$files" | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')

          # 3. prefix for original-code (flowA)
          flowA=$(echo "$bare" | sed 's|[^,]\+|original-code/&|g')

          # 4. prefix for submitted-changes (flowB)
          flowB=$(echo "$bare" | sed 's|[^,]\+|submitted-changes/&|g')

          # 5. export both as outputs
          echo "flowA=$flowA" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "flowB=$flowB" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      # checking out the code without the change of the PR
      - name: Checkout original code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2
          path: original-code
      - run: cd original-code && git checkout HEAD^

      # Running the diff
      - name: Snowflake Flow Diff
        uses: snowflake-labs/snowflake-flow-diff@v0
        id: flowdiff
        with:
          flowA: ${{ steps.files.outputs.flowA }}
          flowB: ${{ steps.files.outputs.flowB }}
```

Note - you may want to change `grep  '\.json$'` with a more specific pattern to match your specific requirements.

## Docker Image

Each release also publishes a Docker image to the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/snowflake-labs/snowflake-flow-diff/pkgs/container/snowflake-flow-diff). This is useful when you want to run the tool directly — for example in a GitLab CI pipeline or locally — without relying on the GitHub Action wrapper.

```
ghcr.io/snowflake-labs/snowflake-flow-diff:latest
ghcr.io/snowflake-labs/snowflake-flow-diff:v0.0.24
```

The image entrypoint accepts the same positional arguments as the action inputs, in this order: `flowA`, `flowB`, `token`, `repository`, `issuenumber`, `checkstyle`, `checkstyle-rules`, `checkstyle-fail`, `api-url`, `flow-graph`.

## GitHub Enterprise Server

This action works with GitHub Enterprise Server (GHE) out of the box. The GitHub API URL is automatically detected via `github.api_url`. If you need to override it for any reason, you can explicitly set the `api-url` input:

```yaml
      - name: Snowflake Flow Diff
        uses: snowflake-labs/snowflake-flow-diff@v0
        id: flowdiff
        with:
          flowA: ${{ steps.files.outputs.flowA }}
          flowB: ${{ steps.files.outputs.flowB }}
          api-url: https://github.example.com/api/v3
```

## Checkstyle

Optionally, it is possible to enable a checkstyle check on the new version of the flow. If some violations against NiFi best practices are found, a message will be added to the comment published on the pull request.

To enable checkstyle:

```yaml
      # Running the diff
      - name: Snowflake Flow Diff
        uses: snowflake-labs/snowflake-flow-diff@v0
        id: flowdiff
        with:
          flowA: ${{ steps.files.outputs.flowA }}
          flowB: ${{ steps.files.outputs.flowB }}
          checkstyle: true
          # optional: path to YAML configuration of the rules
          checkstyle-rules: submitted-changes/.github/checkstyle/checkstyle-rules.yaml
          # optional: fail the action when violations are detected
          checkstyle-fail: true
```

If `checkstyle-fail` is set to `true`, the GitHub Action will exit with a non-zero status whenever checkstyle violations are detected, which ensures the workflow (and therefore the pull request) is blocked until the issues are fixed.

The YAML file can be used to include or exclude specific rules and to configure rule parameters. For example:

```yaml
include:
  - concurrentTasks
rules:
  concurrentTasks:
    parameters:
      limit: 2
    overrides:
      ".*sql-connector":
        limit: 4
    exclude:
      - "Ignore.*"
    componentExclusions:
      "ProdFlow.*":
        - "1a59f65f-8b3a-3db9-982e-e0d334bd7e9c" # processor UUID to ignore
```

At the root level, if `include` is specified, only those rules will be executed. If `exclude` is specified AND `include` is not specified, all rules except the ones specified will be executed. For each rule, it is possible to specify default values for parameters (when supported by the rule, see below), to override parameters for specific flows using a regular expression against the flow name, to exclude flows using a regular expression, and to silence violations for specific component UUIDs via `componentExclusions`.

### Component-level exclusions

Some rules (for example `concurrentTasks`, `noSelfLoop`, `enforcePrioritizer`, or `backpressureThreshold`) may need an exception for a single processor or connection while you keep the rule enabled for the rest of the flow. You can scope exclusions down to the UUID under the `componentExclusions` map, keyed by flow-name regular expressions:

```yaml
include:
  - noSelfLoop
rules:
  noSelfLoop:
    componentExclusions:
      "ProductionFlow.*":
        - "2d8da922-fd1f-3519-9d54-6482dfd42c56"
      ".*": # optional global fallback
        - "50a3b081-d54d-3ad8-b74c-caa7fef59bb2"
```

When the flow name matches the regex, violations produced for the listed component IDs are ignored, while all other components continue to be checked normally.
Use the same pattern for rules that operate on connections (for example `enforcePrioritizer` or `backpressureThreshold`) by listing the connection identifiers to suppress.

### Rule identifiers and exclusion targets

The following table summarizes what each rule reports and which identifiers you can expect when configuring `componentExclusions`:

| Rule id | Violation references | `componentExclusions` target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `concurrentTasks` | Processor name and UUID | Processor UUID (`VersionedProcessor#getIdentifier`) |
| `snapshotMetadata` | Flow name only | _Not applicable_ |
| `emptyParameter` | Parameter name | _Not applicable_ |
| `defaultParameters` | Parameter name | _Not applicable_ |
| `unusedParameter` | Parameter name | _Not applicable_ |
| `noSelfLoop` | Component name/type and UUID | Processor/Funnel UUID at both ends of the self-loop |
| `enforcePrioritizer` | Connection description and UUID | Connection UUID (`VersionedConnection#getIdentifier`) |
| `backpressureThreshold` | Connection description and UUID | Connection UUID (`VersionedConnection#getIdentifier`) |
| `processorNaming` | Processor name, type, and UUID | Processor UUID (`VersionedProcessor#getIdentifier`) |
| `controllerServiceNaming` | Controller Service name, type, and UUID | Controller Service UUID (`VersionedControllerService#getIdentifier`) |
| `parameterContextNaming` | Parameter Context name | _Not applicable_ |
| `parameterProviderNaming` | Parameter Provider name, type, and UUID | _Not applicable_ |

Available rules:
- `concurrentTasks` to check the number of concurrent tasks and define an upper limit (parameter: `limit`, default value is 2)
- `snapshotMetadata` to check that the flow snapshot metadata is present in the file
- `emptyParameter` to check that no parameter is set to an empty string
- `defaultParameters` to check parameters with a default value (parameter: `defaultParameters`, comma-separated list of parameter names having an expected default value)
- `unusedParameter` to check if all specified parameters are used in the flow
- `noSelfLoop` to check if there are self-loop connections in the flow
- `enforcePrioritizer` to check if all connections in the flow are set with the configured list of prioritizers (parameter: `prioritizers`, comma-separated list of expected prioritizers, example: `org.apache.nifi.prioritizer.FirstInFirstOutPrioritizer`)
- `backpressureThreshold` to ensure each connection keeps both data size and object count backpressure thresholds greater than zero
- `processorNaming` to validate processor names against regex patterns based on processor type (parameters: `patterns` map of fully qualified type to regex, optional `defaultPattern` for types not in the map). This rule produces no violations when no patterns are configured.
- `controllerServiceNaming` to validate controller service names against regex patterns based on service type (parameters: `patterns` map of fully qualified type to regex, optional `defaultPattern` for types not in the map). This rule produces no violations when no patterns are configured.
- `parameterContextNaming` to validate parameter context names against a regex pattern (parameters: `defaultPattern` regex, optional `exclude` list of exact names to skip). This rule produces no violations when no pattern is configured.
- `parameterProviderNaming` to validate parameter provider names against regex patterns based on provider type (parameters: `patterns` map of fully qualified type to regex, optional `defaultPattern` for types not in the map). This rule produces no violations when no patterns are configured.

### Naming convention rules

The naming rules (`processorNaming`, `controllerServiceNaming`, `parameterContextNaming`, `parameterProviderNaming`) allow you to enforce custom naming conventions on NiFi components. They are no-ops without configuration, so they are safe to include without side effects.

Patterns are evaluated with Java's `String.matches()`, which requires the **entire** name to match (as if the pattern were implicitly anchored with `^` and `$`). For example, to match names ending in `_SUFFIX`, use `.*_SUFFIX$` rather than `_SUFFIX$`.

#### Processor naming

Validate processor names by type. Use `patterns` to map fully qualified processor types to regex patterns, and `defaultPattern` as a fallback for types not explicitly listed:

```yaml
include:
  - processorNaming
rules:
  processorNaming:
    parameters:
      patterns:
        org.apache.nifi.processors.snowflake.PutSnowflakeInternalStage: ".*_ISTG$"
        org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.ExecuteSQLRecord: ".*_(SEL|COPY|UPD_SEL|UPD_INS|EXT)$|^SP_.*"
        org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.GenerateFlowFile: "^GENERATE_FLOW_FILE$"
        org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.UpdateAttribute: "^UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE$"
        org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.InvokeHTTP: ".*_EXT$"
      defaultPattern: "^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]+$"
    componentExclusions:
      "ProductionFlow.*":
        - "some-processor-uuid-to-ignore"
```

#### Controller service naming

Validate controller service names by type. Works the same as processor naming:

```yaml
include:
  - controllerServiceNaming
rules:
  controllerServiceNaming:
    parameters:
      patterns:
        org.apache.nifi.dbcp.DBCPConnectionPool: "^acme_(dev|preprod|prod)_[a-z0-9_]+$"
      defaultPattern: "^[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$"
```

#### Parameter context naming

Validate parameter context names against a single pattern. Use `exclude` to skip specific context names:

```yaml
include:
  - parameterContextNaming
rules:
  parameterContextNaming:
    parameters:
      defaultPattern: "^acme_(dev|preprod|prod)_[a-z0-9_]+_(secrets|config)$"
      exclude:
        - "common_parameter_context"
        - "common_sftp_serverkey"
        - "CommonDatabaseDriversReference"
```

#### Parameter provider naming

Validate parameter provider (management controller service) names by type:

```yaml
include:
  - parameterProviderNaming
rules:
  parameterProviderNaming:
    parameters:
      patterns:
        org.apache.nifi.parameter.aws.AwsSecretsManagerParameterProvider: "^acme_(dev|preprod|prod)_[a-z0-9_]+_secrets$"
```

All naming rules support the standard `overrides` mechanism to apply different patterns per flow name, and `componentExclusions` to silence violations for specific component UUIDs (where applicable). When a per-flow override specifies `patterns`, it replaces the entire top-level `patterns` map for matching flows rather than merging with it.

## JSON Validation

Before computing a diff, the action validates both flow files for duplicate JSON keys. Duplicate keys are not valid JSON and silently produce wrong diffs because parsers apply last-wins on repeated keys, discarding earlier occurrences. This commonly occurs when a merge conflict is not fully resolved.

If a duplicate key is detected the action posts a `[!CAUTION]` block in the PR comment identifying the file and the exact line, then exits with a non-zero status code so the PR check is blocked until the file is fixed:

```markdown
> [!CAUTION]
> Flow file `submitted-changes/flows/my-flow.json` contains duplicate JSON keys (this typically indicates a merge conflict that was not fully resolved): Duplicate field 'flowContents'
> Line 37, column 17
```

## Example

The GitHub Action will automatically publish a comment on the pull request with a comprehensive description of the changes between the flows of the two branches.
Here is an example of what the comment could look like:
