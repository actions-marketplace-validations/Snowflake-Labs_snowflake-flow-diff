This action is brought to you by [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/), don't hesitate to visit our website and reach out to us if you have questions about this action.

## Usage

When using the GitHub Flow Registry Client in NiFi to version control your flows, add the below file `.github/workflows/flowdiff.yml` to the repository into which flow definitions are versioned.

Whenever a pull request is opened, reopened or when a new commit is pushed to an existing pull request, this workflow will be triggered and will compare the modified flow in the pull request and will
automatically comment the pull request with a human readable description of the changes included in the pull request.

```yaml

          while IFS= read -r file; do
            if [[ $file == *.json ]]; then
              changed_files+=("$file")
            fi
          done <<< "$git_output"
          # Join the array with spaces, properly handling filenames with spaces

      - name: Snowflake Flow Diff

        id: flowdiff
        with:
          flowA: 'original-code/${{ steps.files.outputs.all_changed_files }}'
          flowB: 'submitted-changes/${{ steps.files.outputs.all_changed_files }}'
```

## Example

The GitHub Action will automatically publish a comment on the pull request with a comprehensive description of the changes between the flows of the two branches.
Here is an example of what the comment could look like:

```markdown
